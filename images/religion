        <p><strong>Music: </strong></p><p><strong>Reader:</strong> While the Jews demand miracles and the Greeks look for wisdom,</p><p>here are we preaching a crucified Christ;...</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> This is how in mid first century the apostle Paul wrote to his congregation in the Greek city of Corinth. Christians hear these words in church during Lent, the period leading up to Easter.</p><p><strong>Reader: ...</strong>to the Jews an obstacle that they cannot get over, to the pagans madness...</p><p>1 Cor 1:22-25</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Each year in the compelling liturgies of Holy Week through to Easter, Christians learn about their defining difference...</p><p><strong>Reader:</strong> ... but to those who have been called, whether they are Jews or Greeks, a Christ who is the power and the wisdom of God....</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> To the Jew, Paul, who wrote those words it wasn’t race or ethnicity that defined the called.  It was their ‘yes’ to Jesus as Messiah that made them neither Jew nor pagan.  It’s a spectrum, Jew to pagan, along which a Christian can look two ways; a Jew has one long perspective.  This makes for some notable exchanges, some of them involving scholars, like Karen Kilby who’s been reflecting on more contemporary Jewish thought.</p><p><strong>Karen Kilby:</strong> This particular strand of thought that I have been paying attention to isn’t so centrally located in rabbinic thought but in a series of modern Jewish philosophers, members of the so-called Jewish enlightenment and major 20<sup>th</sup> century thinkers such as <a class="external" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rosenzweig/" target="_blank" title="Rosensweig">Franz Rosenzweig</a>, and also contemporary Jewish thinkers. Quite often these thinkers set up a fundamental opposition between two options in the way you think about God in the world and one is paganism and the other is Judaism.   This opposition centres around the relation between God and nature really. Do you see God as identified with nature and nature itself as sacred? This tends to get construed as the pagan version of religious thought. Or do you understand God’s transcendence as meaning that God is beyond nature?  This is proper Judaism.</p><p>So there’s often this tendency, it’s quite complex in Franz Rosenzweig, but it’s still there, to see an opposition between Judaism and paganism and then to place Christianity on this spectrum. And Christianity is usually placed on the side of Judaism; it does fundamentally accept divine transcendence, it isn’t fundamentally pagan.  But Christianity is seen as kind of tempted by paganism or at risk of paganism or always in danger of veering off towards paganism or perhaps having some pagan elements.  For instance Rosenzweig sees Christianity as sort of unable to believe in the full life and love of God without it being enfleshed and so there is a hint of paganism there. </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Karen Kilby, t<a class="external" href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/staff/profile/?id=12513" target="_blank" title="Karen Kilby at Durham">he Bede Professor of Catholic theology at Durham University</a>. Other discussions along that Jewish-Christian spectrum are in local communities.</p><p><strong>AT TEMPLE BETH ISRAEL </strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Fred Morgan’s hospitable community in Melbourne’s St Kilda is gathering to welcome the Sabbath.  He’s Emeritus Rabbi of <a class="external" href="http://www.tbi.org.au/" target="_blank" title="Temple Beth Israel">Temple Beth Israel</a> and as a member of the Victorian Council of Christians and Jews, he’s pushing a project that takes exchanges between Christians and Jews beyond the committed or ‘converted to dialogue’, to the grassroots.</p><p><strong>Fred Morgan:</strong> What we’ve done in the project is to recruit members of different denominations both Christians and Jews right across the board, and train them to be able to talk about their own faith journeys and the meaning of their Judaism or their Christianity in their lives and how it‘s brought them to consider that interfaith engagement is an important value within the religious context. These people then are going out into churches and synagogues to talk about their experience.  If we held a special meeting on some weekday evening, we’d only be preaching again to the converted. So we’ve decided to go in at times of worship when we will get a varied crowd.  The idea is to talk to people when they’re most comfortable and at ease with what they are doing.<div class="inline-content photo full">

      </a></div>
</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Rabbi Morgan has brought together some of his grassroots dialogue project volunteers.</p><p><strong>Steve Sutton:</strong>  One of the communities I am involved in is a fairly conservative church setting – and surprising, they were very open to welcoming the project into the Sunday worship service.</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Steve Sutton is pastor of <a class="external" href="http://www.fitzroynorthchurch.org.au/" target="_blank" title="Fitzroy North Community Church">Fitzroy North Community Church</a> – a church grown out of the Churches of Christ tradition.</p><p><strong>Steve Sutton:</strong>  I’ve had conversations with Fred about his view on Trinitarian theology and I was surprised to find that – I’m not, not placing this on Fred - but as Christians we’re perceived as being polytheistic, idol worshippers – would that be fair to say?</p><p><strong>Fred Morgan:</strong> By some Jewish people, certainly, Christianity was seen as, would be seen, as a form of idol-worship.  Most Jewish people would probably not go so far as to say that, but they might feel it, because this isn’t just about what’s in your head is it, it’s about what’s in your heart.  </p><p><strong>Steve Sutton:</strong>  We had invited Fred to come and speak to our Church community without knowing the level of courage that it required for him to walk in through our doors.  I was unaware of the fact that there was this wrestle with viewing the Christian faith as polytheistic and also that it really isn’t permitted within Jewish circles for a Jew to come into a Christian place of worship.     </p><p><strong>Bracha Rafael:</strong>  My name is Bracha. I’m a 25 year old paramedic. I grew up in the <a class="external" href="http://www.chabad.org/" target="_blank" title="Chabad">Chabad</a> Jewish community.   I’ve studied Judaism for a year overseas in a modern Orthodox seminary, so primarily Talmud but other Judaic texts.<em>   </em> At this point I don’t live the tradition as I grew up with it but it is something that is very much still with me day to day and something that I think about and care about a lot. </p><p><strong>Fred Morgan:</strong>  I’m very admiring of all of the Jewish participants in this project. After the period of the Enlightenment many Jewish people overcame that sort of hesitation about entering churches but it still remains a real issue for other segments of the Jewish community, mainly the Orthodox. And I think it’s not just because of the polytheism which isn’t really something that Jews consciously carry around with them very much. But there’s also a history of anti-Semitism and forced sermonising at Jews which I think many in the community have reacted against, and all of this leads to a kind of a hesitation when it comes to interfaith work sometimes or any kinds of interactions between Jews and Christians. But we live in a different kind of society now from the sort of society that created those kinds of experiences. And I think that’s really one of the important things about this project, that it represent Christians and Jews living together in a multicultural society and having to rethink I guess both of our positions vis a vis each other.     </p><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> This is a week that draws the Christian mind to things Jewish and Christian, as the Lenten liturgies give way to the events of Holy Week.</p><p>A few weeks back, when Christians listened in Church to those words from Paul, there was a follow up from the <a class="external" href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/john/0" target="_blank" title="Gospel of John">Gospel of John</a> about a sliver of Jesus’ intensely Jewish life, and in the Temple: frequenting the Temple, asserting Temple rules about respect for the sacred, taking a position in Jewish debates.</p><p><strong>Reader: </strong>Just before the Jewish Passover Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and in the Temple he found people selling cattle and sheep and pigeons, and the money changers sitting at their counters there. Making a whip out of some cord, he drove them all out of the Temple, cattle and sheep as well...  </p><p>Jn2: 13-25</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> In this Holy Week, Christians hear again from John, very often - from Palm Sunday to Holy Thursday to Good Friday and Saturday or Sunday’s Easter celebration. They hear of Jesus doing Jewish things. And they hear over and over of ‘the Jews’. On Good Friday John tells Christians that ‘the Jews’ brought Jesus before Pilate, to be condemned.</p><p><strong>Reader: (Extracts from John’s Gospel reading for Good Friday)</strong> The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. Jesus answered...</p><p>At these words, one of the guards standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face, saying,</p><p>Is that the way to answer the high priest?...</p><p>It was now morning. They did not go into the Praetorium themselves or they would be defiled and unable to eat the passover...</p><p>They replied,</p><p>If he were not a criminal, we should not be handing him over to you...</p><p>The Jews answered,</p><p>We are not allowed to put a man to death...</p><p>Pilate answered,</p><p>Am I a Jew? It is your own people and the chief priests who have handed you over to me:    what have you done?...</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> If you’ve ever stood in a church during that long powerful telling from John’s Gospel of Jesus’ passion and death, you’ll know just how unnervingly those words, ‘the Jews’, enter the consciousness. It’s not possible for any Christian to hear them without knowing, without 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> century ears. </p><p>John’s Gospel is one good reason why in this Holy Week the rub between Jews and Christians is at its most aggravated.    It’s also a week when the Jewish roots of Christianity are constantly articulated and made present to Christians in the scriptural readings they hear.  And this year it will be in the conjunction of actual events that are being marked by Jews and Christians: in 2015, as happens occasionally, Passover and Easter coincide.</p><p><strong>At <a class="external" href="http://apps.acu.edu.au/staffdirectory/index.php?todo=2" target="_blank" title="Moloney ACU">Frank Moloney</a>’s library.</strong></p><p><strong>Francis J.

Come on upstairs Margaret, go ahead of me upstairs.</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> So this is where all the books are?</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> Yes, this is where I’ve got all my personal library after forty years of wandering all over the world, with all these books. They won’t move now until they carry me out.</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> And there they are! Great. So this is John’s Gospel room...  </p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> That’s that shelf. I have a lot of books. I’ve brought all of them home now. They’re in the corridor, outside, in the television room, in my bedroom...that’s where it all started.  </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> And when you say that’s that shelf, it’s not one shelf, it’s a whole lot of shelves and everywhere I look on the bindings the word John comes up...</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> That’s right. That’s a library that began way back when I began my research at the University of Oxford in the 1970s.  So John has become my specialisation.  </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> It is true to say isn’t it that you really do inhabit John’s Gospel?</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> I do. I was just thinking to myself of latter years there is not a corner in it that I haven’t visited for one reason or another. So whenever anything Johannine comes up you know immediately where to go; you know immediately not only where to go, what the problems are, what the people discuss about that question.  And what has been really interesting for me in my present situation is that in the last fifteen, twenty years there has [sic] been quite radical shifts in the way in which we approach a biblical text. I have the text at my fingertips but people keep asking different questions of the text and that keeps me very much in the field and very much interested in what’s going on.   </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> At 75, Frank Moloney is teaching, writing, heading up <a class="external" href="http://www.acu.edu.au/about_acu/faculties,_institutes_and_centres/theology_and_philosophy/institute_for_religion_and_critical_inquiry/biblical_and_early_christian_studies" target="_blank" title="Frank Moloney at ACU">Australian Catholic University’s Institute for Religion and Critical Inquiry</a> – he has a book based on John about to come out later this year.  It’s set to enter an important Pope Francis engineered discussion in the Catholic Church about pastoral care of divorced and remarried people.<div class="inline-content photo full">

</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> To this day I have an absolute fascination with what the word of God has got to say, not just John but the whole shooting match.   So many things that are part of our life flow from the Word of God. People don’t even know what they are saying when they say I am going to wash my hands of that – and all these fundamental things that are formative of our culture. For that reason alone I think it’s terrific. But of course there is a level of faith.  There is a belief that somehow or other there is a communication of the design of God for human kind through these various texts, whether it be the Jewish scriptures, whether it be our own Christian scriptures, and within  each of those scriptures there are different voices, sometimes conflicting. All of that I find intellectually fascinating and humanly stimulating and then at the level of faith extremely nourishing. </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> On his desk is an unprecedented volume that’s realigning our sense of the connections between Jews and Christians: it’s a New Testament carefully annotated by Jewish scholars – <a class="external" href="http://arts.uottawa.ca/cla-srs/en/people/reinhartz-adele" target="_blank" title="Adele Reinhartz">Adele Reinhartz</a>, the scholar who writes about John’s Gospel, acknowledges that it’s called the most Jewish and the most anti-Jewish of the Gospels.</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> There wasn’t a clear break. So much that was inherent in the Jewishness of early Christianity is fundamental to our texts and this is the value of this book. At every turn they will show you, oh well this is found here, or this is in conflict with this, etc. As you read through the New Testament you find note after note after note showing how this is paralleled in Jewish thought or occasionally, this is foreign to Jewish thought.  It’s a beautiful interface between the Jewish tradition and the Christian tradition and it shows how close we are.   Why do we celebrate Passover?   </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Do we celebrate Passover? Isn’t that a vexed question?</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> Well, we have transformed the liberating nature of Passover.  That’s the difference. We have taken the Passover story and the Passover – even that’s symbolic - of the freedom that’s symbolised by the meal and if you go to a Passover <em>seder</em> you see things on the table to symbolise various things looking back largely on the Exodus story and then beautiful, the Haggadah, the story that’s told, very wonderful to hear them telling the Exodus story and the liberation that comes with the action of God for his people and applying it to our own contemporary situations, either in the family, in the country, in the world. Now, what we’ve done, our theology should still be one of the liberating action of God but of course we’ve transformed it into the death and resurrection of Jesus and that of course is a radical transformation of the Jewish Passover. And in some ways you’re quite right to say can we rightly call it ‘celebrate the Passover’? No we don’t celebrate the Passover, that’s what they do. We could say ‘the Paschal events’, which has its links with Passover but it also has its links with passion, with suffering and resurrection out of suffering. But I don’t want to lose the link of the freedom generated by the intervention of the act of God that comes through what happens in the events of Jesus, that have its roots in the Passover. That‘s the root, and that’s why it is very important on Holy Thursday night, that’s what we read. We read the Exodus story – that’s where we come from.</p><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Among the scholars who are contributors to the <a class="external" href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-jewish-annotated-new-testament-9780195297706?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" title="Jewish Annotated New Testament">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a> is one Australian, <a class="external" href="http://shalem.ac.il/en/personnel/michael-fagenblat/" target="_blank" title="Michael Fagenblat">Michael Fagenblat</a> – he writes on Jewish and Christian understandings of neighbour.  The co-editor is Professor Amy-Jill – A-J – Levine, who also annotates Luke’s Gospel.</p><p><strong>Amy-Jill Levine:</strong> In a few cases some Jewish readers or potential readers found the Jewish Annotated New Testament problematic.  They asked why we would be involved looking at this text that they thought was anti-Semitic and dangerous and counter to everything Judaism stood for. And the problem there I think is just one of ignorance – they’ve never read the text, they don’t know how the text would have sounded in its original historical context, and they refuse to acknowledge that the people in the text, whether Jesus or Paul or Mary Magdalen, these are all Jews. So to look at Christian origins is actually to recover part of Jewish history.   <div class="inline-content photo full">

</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> What made the enterprise possible? And I wonder AJ if you could answer that in two ways, on a personal level because there is something about you as a person that made the enterprise possible, but there’s also something about the times isn’t there?</p><p><strong>Amy-Jill Levine:</strong> We’re coming up on one of the major anniversaries of Vatican 11, the Roman Catholic document <a class="external" href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html" target="_blank" title="Nostra Aetate"><em>Nostra Aetate</em></a>, which proclaimed in the 1960s that Jews in all times and in all places should not be held responsible for the death of Jesus, and because of Vatican 11 a sea change occurred in general Christian attitudes, not just Catholic, but general Christian attitudes towards Jews. In part I think we were able to put the Jewish Annotated New Testament together as a response to this olive branch sent out to the Jewish community. We are at the time where we can have over fifty Jewish contributors annotating every single book in the New Testament, as well as contributing back essays on New Testament background.</p><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><p><strong>Amy-Jill Levine:</strong> Growing up in the synagogue my Jewish education was quite good and I knew a lot of Jewish history up until the time of the <a class="external" href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Maccabees.html" target="_blank" title="Maccabees">Maccabees</a> – this is the Hanukah story from the second century BC, in the 160s before Jesus. And then suddenly like magic we were over into the period of the <a class="external" href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/talmud_&amp;_mishna.html" target="_blank" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a>, in the second century of the Common Era.  If I want to know something about first century Jewish history, about what the Romans were doing in the land of Israel, about Pharisees and Sadducees, about development of the idea of resurrection of the dead, then the New Testament is one of the best sources that I have. In effect the New Testament preserves for me my own history.</p><p>If I want to know about Jewish Christian relations then looking at the New Testament, both the text and its interpretation, help me because it is not as if Judaism over the past 2000 years developed in a vacuum. Much of contemporary Judaism took its own shape in dialogue and debate with the development of the Christian Church, so I need to know about Christianity in order to know about Judaism.</p><p>I am also very well aware of how on multiple occasions and in multiple ways Christians over the centuries have misinterpreted Jesus Jewish context, have misunderstood Judaism, and consequently have come up with anti- Jewish teachings and preachings. So by my looking at the New Testament in its own Jewish context, I‘m able to correct some of those negative and false stereotypes or preclude those negative teachings from  being passed on to the next generations. </p><p><strong>Music:  </strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> <a class="external" href="http://divinity.vanderbilt.edu/people/bio/amy-jill-levine" target="_blank" title="AJ Levine">A-J Levine,</a> who says she reads a lot of sermons in her role at Vanderbilt University’s Divinity school – sermons written by Christian students for the ministry.  That’s why in the Jewish Annotated New Testament she takes the parable of the Prodigal Son from Luke’s Gospel and looks at it through a Jewish lens – check out the distinctiveness that brings at Earshot’s website (you can find your way there from ABC RN).</p><p><strong>Music:   </strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> But in this week, Holy Week, Christians listen to John, the Gospel so familiar to Frank Moloney.</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney: </strong> Speaking from an interested position, the theologian has the responsibility, very serious responsibility, to look at the given, to look at what the Jewish scriptures and the Christian scriptures and then the way particularly, in my particular Christian tradition, the way those scriptures have been revealed and then articulated across the centuries in an attempt to speak to real life at that time. My responsibility, with my training and with my enthusiasm, is to reflect upon that tradition and to in some way without betraying the tradition make it relevant and understandable to the world of today.  </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> John’s Gospel must play a particularly important role here in this consideration because it stands at a kind of balance point doesn’t it. I’m thinking on the one hand of its hugely symbolic kind of content but on the other hand its very fleshy content.</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> The secret to why John is like that and so different is that the Gospel of John appeared on the scene, pretty widely accepted opinion, toward the end of the century, probably somewhere in Asia Minor.</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> This is the century in which Jesus lived and died, say in the year 33? </p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> And now we’re out about 100 in the first Christian century. And Christianity has now clearly broken away from its Jewish roots but it’s facing the problem it is now going to have to make sense of the old story in a largely Greco-Roman world. And so John, particularly through his use of symbol, through his rich use of the very physicality – you know, it’s only in John where he becomes flesh.  His miracles aren’t just little miracles, they are massive miracles! I mean if he’s going to change water into wine he makes a hundred gallons of the stuff, you know. All of the miracles are quite spectacular:  it is not just a blind man who gets cured, it’s a man who has been born blind, who’s never seen before; it’s not just the raising of somebody from the dead but he’s been dead for four days! So there’s the overstatement all the time of the physicality of it and yet if you were just to tell the story that wouldn’t do it justice.  What is the symbolic value of this?</p><p>So there is this powerful link between the fleshiness of the reality of Christianity in history and yet it transcends that – it speaks beyond that. Now this was the wonder of this particular gospel that it did cross that bridge.  I regard John’s gospel as a great bridge crosser. It goes away from the world in which Christianity was born and boldly speaks into a new world, often using terminology of that new world which led it into problem: later in the second Christian century many of the heretical groups said oh this is our Gospel, this uses the language that we use.</p><p>On this whole thing there is a very beautiful book I think one of the most beautiful books written by an Australian Johannine scholar Dorothy Lee and the name of the book is <a class="external" href=" http://www.crossroadpublishing.com/crossroad/title/flesh-and-glory" target="_blank" title="Flesh and Glory site">Flesh and Glory</a> and it just captures exactly what John is trying to do there. He has crossed that bridge into very dangerous area, managed to keep the balancing act between an incarnate Jesus and the reality of his flesh and blood, and yet somehow communicate to us that the divine also breaks into that story. Now that is a pretty tricky balancing act. The fact that he succeeded is evidence by the fact that we are still reading it.   </p><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> Frank Moloney, and <a class="external" href="http://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/people/staff-directory/dorothy-lee.html" target="_blank" title="Dorothy Lee">Dorothy Lee</a>, whose book <a class="external" href="http://shalem.ac.il/en/personnel/michael-fagenblat/" target="_blank" title="Flesh and Glory">Flesh and Glory</a> he referred to, wrote about the way the symbolism of John’s Gospel is open to the perspectives and experiences of women readers. </p><p>Contemporary American poet Mary Karr is such a reader – here she is with that characteristic John balancing act between Flesh and Glory.</p><p><strong>Mary Karr: [</strong><a class="external" href=" http://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/audioitem/3888" target="_blank" title="Mary Karr at Poetry Foundation">Reading <strong><em>Disgraceland</em></strong></a>]<strong> </strong>For a biography of Mary Karr see also: <a class="external" href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mary-karr#poet"><strong>http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mary-karr#poet</strong></a> </p><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> Mary Karr reading for us her poem <em>Disgraceland</em>, thanks to the Poetry Foundation.  She <a class="external" href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/audioitem/3888" target="_blank" title="Mary Karr on PF">talks about the poem at the website of the Poetry Foundation</a> and there’s a link at Earshot to that site.</p><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> You’re with RN’s Earshot – and we’re canvassing the spectrum described by the apostle Paul, in first century letter to the Corinthians, a group in Paul’s terms neither Jew nor pagan, but most probably some of them were Jews, amongst a majority of Gentiles.   I’m talking with biblical scholar Professor Frank Moloney.</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> John dramatises everything doesn’t he, in relation to the Jewish context by implicitly making Jesus the lamb of the feast that was to take place the following day, in quite a confronting way for a Jewish reader? </p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> That’s actually in the text. In John 6 when he’s talking about the bread from heaven, it is all very well when he is talking about the bread from heaven which primarily means the gift of the law. But then eventually he starts talking about whoever eats my flesh, begins to talk about my flesh is the flesh given for the life of the world. And in the text itself, the Jewish audience says, ‘this is impossible, you know; how can this man give us his flesh to eat?’ So there is this very profound contrast between this Jewish tradition, very important tradition, and this Christian symbolic use of flesh of course in that instance to refer to Eucharist.</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey: </strong> You wrote a book a long while ago which you are now preparing for publication, which is actually taking that aspect of John in order to attend to some of the issues are that are facing people today.<div class="inline-content photo full">

</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> Way back when I was just teaching all the gospels and everything else it continually struck me forcibly that whenever there were Eucharistic texts, symbolically Eucharistic  or the actual recalling of the meal that Jesus celebrated, you will always find them in the context of failing people. Always. Whether it is the bread miracle in the Gospels – the disciples will say send them away, send them away, Jesus will say no, you give them something to eat, bring what you’ve got and let’s do something with it.  So when you get to the actual institution narratives that you find toward the Passion it is always the failing disciples: Judas is about the betray him, Peter is going to deny him, the others don’t know what he is talking about and they are going to flee, and then he breaks his body – he uses this symbolic action – a body broken for you, blood spilled for you. For who? For these people who were there at the table with him. So there’s this continual interface between the fragility of the people whom Jesus loves unconditionally and the fact that he doesn’t seem to mind. So I wrote way back then in 1990 a book called A Body Broken for a Broken People which really looked at the Eucharistic texts. Of course in the back of my mind were contemporary urgent problems: that often the churches do not use Eucharist as a place where the Lord, the risen Lord, meets the broken or the poor or the sinful but in fact has a rather selective audience in mind and there is even legislation about who can and cannot come. And particularly important even back then was in the back of my mind the issue of the divorced and remarried.  So this second edition, I’ve reworked the whole book and I have a long chapter now actually looking at the divorce texts in the New Testament. And my argument is that the tradition that we should be defending is the one I have just been talking about and that we need to rethink this whole question of exclusion from the table. Now I do not mean a willy-nilly access of everybody, but the believing person who reaches out in faith should be nourished at the table whatever their situation.</p><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> You can find a note to this effect in the Jewish Annotated New Testament. Professor Levine.</p><p><strong>Amy-Jill Levine:</strong> Sometimes in churches we talk about altars but what we really have in a church is the table. Jesus met people at table and he is quite indiscriminate in his dining – he dines with sinners and tax collectors – the modern analogy would be he dines with drug dealers and arms dealers, child abusers, people who violate the communal sense, the communal good.  We even have a sense of that table – this is a place where my students are stunned to find this – the Christmas story in the Gospel of Luke which talks about how Mary gave birth to her first born son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger. And then I say to my students, do you know what a manger is, yeh it is a bed of hay, well it is a feeding trough, like the French <em>manger</em> to eat. Where else do you put the person who will be acknowledged as bread of the world but in a feeding trough? Luke is giving us that table symbolism right in the Christmas story and we miss it. The idea here is in part from the Jewish view of what happens in the world to come, the kingdom of heaven. In many Jewish sources the kingdom of heaven is a giant banquet, where you dine with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and where everybody has enough to eat and where everybody and it doesn’t matter what your background or your class or your gender or your politics, you all break bread together and Jesus is meeting people at table, setting up that...that kingdom of heaven banquet right on earth as if to say if you break bread with somebody then that person who sits at your table is part of your family.  And it’s a gorgeous message and it is a very Jewish one. What do you do in the kingdom of heaven? You eat!   </p><p><strong>At North Fitzroy Community Church</strong></p><p><strong>Steve Sutton:</strong> Our history or our tradition is anchored in Old Testament Scripture, goes back to Abraham, so we’ve got something to gain from the relationship.  In some respects for Jewish people there isn’t that connection with Christianity, with Christ. We’re at an advantage.</p><p><strong>Fred Morgan:</strong>    It was really visiting Steve’s church, the Fitzroy North Community Church – it kind of brought the idea of a project like this to me in the first place.  What bowled me over when I went to the Church was the level of hospitality. I know that hospitality is crucial to creating true dialogue – you have to be able to communicate on a basic human level, welcoming the stranger, before you can do anything else.  And your church was fantastic at doing that. That’s just part of their ethos. So I felt welcomed in saying whatever I felt I needed to say and people listened with respect – that’s really what it is all about. I’m sure they didn’t agree with all I said, But that is not the important thing here. </p><p><strong>Steve Sutton:</strong> The imperative for interfaith dialogue for myself is a dual thing. One is the fact that we now live in a pluralistic society where Christianity and the Church now sits on the margins. That’s just practical, that we now must engage in interfaith dialogue. Secondly, meeting Fred – so for me the impetus has come from the influence of somebody who has a relationship with God and engages with Scripture in a way that has been incredibly helpful for myself. <em> </em></p><p><strong>Bracha Rafael:</strong> I can say with some degree of certainty that I intend to have kids and I intend to raise them in this city and so now I have concerns about what kind of city that is, what kind of society that I live in and I do think that culture is something very much at our fingertips, something that we create, something that we have power over, and I want to contribute to a culture where dialogue and understanding and harmony are a part of our lives.  That needs to be made. It is not just going to happen. That’s why I am drawn to interfaith dialogue.  </p><p><strong>Steve Sutton:</strong> I find your story so fascinating because what it suggests is regardless of our faith tradition both Christians and Jews that are serious about what it is that they believe are asking questions and reshaping their particular faith. And I think that’s one of the things that we all share in common, that our faith is not static, regardless of what tradition we’re from. We are in a process of thinking it through, deconstructing, reconstructing and shaping a faith that is meaningful for us.  </p><p><strong>Bracha Rafael:</strong>  When I spoke it was Pesach Shema which begins with God commanding the Israelites to bring forth gifts of their hearts to build the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabernacle" target="_blank" title="Tabernacle"><em>mishkan</em></a>, the tabernacle. The <em>mishkan</em> was a portable place of worship, it was assembled and disassembled as needed and carried through the desert with the Israelites wanderings and I couldn’t really come up with a better metaphor for faith in today’s world. So thank you Steve.  </p><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Unsettledness, wandering as a metaphor for contemporary faith: it’s a real enough experience that produces different responses, amongst Jews and Christians.  Karen Kilby was struck by the view towards paganism from the Jewish other end of the axis, a view that’s in a sense interrupted by Christianity.  She took up with the ideas of some modern Jewish thinkers as a lens through which to view that modern experience of unsettledness amongst Christians.</p><p><strong>Karen Kilby:</strong> If you look at the dominant trends in contemporary Christian theological thinking there tends to be a sense that modernity, with its disenchantment and its enlightenment represents loss and temptation and something we need to resist, we need to go back and retrieve something that has gone on before. I’m not talking just about you know a fundamentalist version of Christianity but even very sophisticated theological visions and quite a variety of them but they would consistently think of the major danger facing contemporary Christian theology as to be too enamoured of modernity, to be too concerned to make sense in the modern context and to lose their distinctiveness. So they see often that theological liberalism, that the desire to accommodate and make yourself heard and adjust to modernity is seen as quite central temptation of Christianity.   <div class="inline-content photo full">

</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> And this is where you retrieve the notion of paganism from those Jewish thinkers perhaps as offering a critical category that is never made use of really in contemporary Christian theology and you make quite enabling use of it, particularly to approach two dominant figures in Christian, in Catholic theology specifically.<em>   </em></p><p><strong>Karen Kilby:</strong> I found this way of thinking among some modern Jewish thinkers very interesting because they see the oppositions quite differently from the way that I had been used to thinking about things as a Christian theologian.  So, if you see modernity as in part a Jewish gift to the world, a coming forth or a fulfilment of a Jewish notion of divine transcendence, that this is at least somehow consonant with modernity, then paganism in addition to liberalism could become a category of danger. So in other words, my thought is if we listen to this worry, even though Christian theologians are unlikely to want take on entirely the vision of these Jewish thinkers: as a Christian theologian I am not going to want to say yes, the incarnation is a problematically pagan vision. But still, if I say should their categories for thinking about the temptations of Christianity be taken seriously by Christian theologians, so that we also consider, is a danger of a slide into paganism also a real danger for us, I think this could be a useful counterbalance to the worry about liberal accommodation that dominates a lot of contemporary theology. So in particular, as you suggest, I use this to think about the relation of two dominant 20<sup>th</sup> century Catholic theologians, <a class="external" href="http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/bce/rahner.htm" target="_blank" title="Karl Rahner">Karl Rahner</a> and <a class="external" href="http://hansursvonbalthasar.blogspot.com.au/" target="_blank" title="Hans Urs von Balthasar">Hans Urs von Balthasar</a>. So these two theologians are often seen as two basic roads down which Christian theology or Catholic theology can go, where Rahner who makes use of Kantian terms and who talks about the need to take seriously the fact that we are modern people and that we have to rearticulate Catholic theology in modern terms, he’s seen as pulling in a liberal direction.  And Hans Urs Von Balthasar, who is very critical of modernity, is seen at the moment as the richer thinker; he is not at risk of this liberalism that people see in Rahner. And I think if we use these categories and ask, well what about paganism, then it becomes very clear that Balthasar looks like he really is at risk in his rejection of modernity and in his wanting to sort of re-enchant the world. He is certainly at risk of sliding back into paganism, it seems to me, or of dabbling in paganism so that the categories of Jewish critique of Christianity seem to catch, seem to make sense, when you apply them to Balthasar. </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong>  You’re referring there to what you describe as the remythologising of certain figures, of Mary perhaps and the use of particular kinds of symbolism for important categories in Catholic theological thinking, the idea of the Church for example?  </p><p><strong>Karen Kilby:</strong> Yes that’s right, there are various levels on which Hans Urs von Balthasar you could see him as remythologising Christianity.  Symbolism of let’s say Mary for the Church is very traditional and seeing Mary not just as a very particular figure but reading her as representing something fundamental. But he sorts of embroiders and expands on the tendency of having particular figures like Mary and Peter and John become types, mythic figures, who represent the different possibilities within the Church. And as you mentioned his nuptial theology is this very sexed understanding of the Church and the church in relation to Christ and God in relation to the world. He casts all these things in terms of a meeting of the male and female and I think this nuptial theology in Balthasar’s would ring the alarm bells around the idea of paganism.  </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> You know, someone listening to this who loves their favourite saint, who accepts the Trinity and so on, you’re not saying that this is all in need of de-mythologising?</p><p><strong>Karen Kilby:</strong> Yes, that’s a good question. I’m not saying that you know we should strip away anything in Christianity that doesn’t fit with Judaism.  That wouldn’t be a thing you could recommend to Christian theology or Christian theologians. There are commitments that Christians have that run so deep that they are not up for grabs and for reconsideration. The doctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation and quite a lot that follows from that I’m not suggesting that we could reconsider them and to some degree we just have to live with the view that some Jews might think that we incline towards paganism. But, at the same time I think to hear the worry and to consider whether there could be a pressure to go too far in a certain direction seems worthwhile to me.   </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> <a class="external" href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/staff/profile/?id=12513" target="_blank" title="Karen Kilby">Karen Kilby, the Bede Professor of Catholic theology at Durham University</a>.  You can find out about her various publications at Earshot’s website, via ABCRN.</p><p>Dorothy Lee, the Johannine scholar to whose book Flesh and Glory Frank Moloney referred earlier, closed her book with a comment that draws us back to the experience of reading a text like John’s Gospel.</p><p><strong>Dorothy Lee:</strong> The reader is never a solitary figure within Christian understanding.  The reader always lives and reads within the context of community and a community of faith, the community of faith in Christian tradition and other communities of faith that are related to the Christian tradition, particularly of course Jewish readers who are the source of the New Testament for us and whose reading is vitally important to what we’re doing today in our reading. So that image that we often get of the reader struggling all alone, reading by themselves, trying to interpret the text, agonising over the text, is really a kind of false image, it’s the Enlightenment situation and it is really not how the text should be read, it’s not how the text was written. The text is written in community by communities and the text is to be read in community, by communities, in partnership, in a common reading where all voices are heard at the table.</p><p>The reader, the true reader of the text of something like John’s Gospel or any New Testament text, not only is a reader of that one text but also needs to hear the voices of others down through the centuries. We need to be there at the table listening to all those other voices in order to interpret the text.  The other dimension is that the text is not just read by reading even in dialogue.  The text is also read in action. The text is interpreted when we act justly, when we act lovingly, when we act out the true meaning and the ethics of the text.</p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Professor Dorothy Lee Dean of <a class="external" href="http://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/learning/theological-school.html" target="_blank" title="Trinity Theological School">Trinity Theological School </a>within the University of Divinity.</p><p>To take her point, this week Christians who are reading John’s Gospel within their own communities of faith, hearing the drama of those last days of Jesus and the role of the people John calls ‘the Jews’ are also of course reading within a wider community that includes Jews.</p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> This is an enormous problem and has been for many centuries because it has been the source of hatred between Christians and Jews, particularly on the part of Christians who were the dominant force and it has very clear origins. I mean the origins come from the fact that late in the first century there was a parting of the ways, that it became clear to the Jews and to the Christians that you couldn’t accept that Jesus was the Christ and stay together. It would have probably taken place, gradually, slowly; there is evidence that Christians and Jews were still celebrating together even into the second century, and I think this is what we need to remember when we look at this problem even with John’s Gospel.  The Jews in John’s Gospel are not ‘the Jews’ as we know them.</p><p><strong>Amy-Jill Levine:</strong> Yes, we even have a back article on the use of the term Jew. The Greek term would be <em>iudaios</em> singular or plural and it is legitimate to translate that term as Judean stressing the  geographical location, the location of Judea, rather than Jew or Jewish which tends to have a more  religious connection or a connection with people today. There are a number of people who particularly in reading the Gospel of John during Holy Week get very nervous about John’s talking about the Jews, the Jews, the Jews, particularly since the Jews in the Gospel of John don’t always come off as the most benevolent of people. So for some people who don’t want to convey any sort of anti-Jewish stereotype they find it easier to talk about the Judeans or the religious leaders or the political leaders and not mention Jews at all. For me personally I understand the rationale behind these changes but l I’m not interested in erasing quote unquote Jewish presence in the New Testament.  I would much rather have the term <em>iudaios</em> be translated Jew and then have people in the churches alerted to what happens when prejudice tends to accompany language. Christians reading about Jews in the New Testament should no more come out feeling anti-Jewish or anti-Semitic than I do when I read about how awful the Egyptians were according to the Book of Exodus or how awful the Persians were according to the Book of Esther.  That doesn’t make me hate Egyptians or Iranians.   So I think rather than shift translation and bowdlerise the text, engage in better education within church contexts. </p><p><strong>Francis J. Moloney:</strong> Now the Jews therefore always needs to be understood as a symbolic use of this most unfortunate expression, but it means those people who have made a conscious decision against the possibility that God has made himself known in and through the story of Jesus.  In the story, if you read the story carefully, that’s what they oppose: how can this man claim to be from heaven, how can this man claim to be the son of God, and they throw him out of the synagogue.  Now that reflects what was going on between the Christians – Jews – and other Jews on the other side of the road who’ve got their synagogue, and they are saying sorry boys and girls you’re not going to come back into the synagogue any more, and the actual Greek word that’s used in the John 9 episode, is [language] they throw them out of the synagogue, and Jesus later in his discourse to the disciples will say, they will throw you out of the synagogues. That happened. But these were all Jews. This is the point. So ‘the Jews’ don’t represent the Jews. They represent people who take a stance against even the possibility that God has entered the human story in and through the person of Jesus. Many people will nowadays translate ‘the Jewish leaders’. That’s not correct, because it doesn’t really reflect a political, social, ethnic position. It reflects a mind set, it reflects a rejection of the possibility of what God might be doing in and through the person of Jesus Christ. But that is very difficult to explain on Good Friday.</p><p><strong>Amy-Jill Levine:</strong> The better theological response to who killed Jesus would be human sin, or everyone.  The Gospels themselves make it clear that pretty much every group has a hand in it, from some of Jesus’ own followers to the political officials running the Jerusalem contingent from the Jewish population, Caiaphas the High Priest, to the Romans, to the crowds who could have stormed the cross and don’t . So if we get the theology right and we get the history right we are much less likely to come up with anti-Jewish concerns, and I think if we get the history right then we can raise the good questions that need to be raised today. Like, how do we understand empire?  For what is it worth dying? When have we betrayed others? What innocent people are still dying today? What do we think about capital punishment, which here in the United States in some of our states we still have? How do we find hope in a place of execution?  What’s the story after the story – how do we go on?  If we ask the right questions we are in a better position to understand the New Testament better and I think in a better position to understand our own faith regardless of what faith that is. </p><p><strong>Margaret Coffey:</strong> Thanks to all the contributors to this program – Jew, pagan...

	<p class="comment">This was interesting and I shall be following up some of the reading, particularly the Jewish-annotated NT.<br />My familiarity with classical and Hellenistic sources has made me very conscious of the strong rhetorical and philosophical borrowings in the NT (not a novel observation, I know) and I've always been curious about the extent to which the early church was influenced by Jewish tradition. <br /><br />The use of 'Christian&quot; to mean specifically western (Roman) catholic bemused me. It soon became apparent that that was the whole position of the broadcast, but I'm puzzled about why that was not made explicit.</p>

	<p class="comment">I'm not sure that I agree that Christians - at least, they shouldn’t hear it – hear: &quot;Did ‘the Jews’ kill Jesus? This 'Holy Week' when Christians listen to John’s Gospel as they follow the Passion of Jesus Christ, that’s what they hear.&quot;<br /><br />What we can do is point the finger at Jesus himself - it was his choice to die. No one forced him. His entire reason for existing as a human was to die.<br /><br />In my experience growing up in a Christian household, with missionary parents, preacher grandfathers and going to a Christian school full of Bible studies for most of my schooling, I never once heard anyone blame the people living in Israel at that time for Jesus' death and neither did anyone else I know who still follows Christianity.  <br /><br />Although I'd love to hear from anyone in the comments here if they WERE taught that! <br /><br />Fundamentalist religiosity may have played a part but you can find that in any religion, cult and belief system – all human beings will stuff up, mis-interpret their religious texts, live hypocritically and so on. Also, remember that &quot;Whoever here is without sin can be the first to throw a stone at her.&quot; The meaning of this is that if you’re perfect, then you can judge others. None of us are perfect, therefore none of us should judge anyone else - least of all Christians for whom this message is intended.</p>

	<p class="comment">I wrote a 70,000 word dramatization of the events around the life and death of Jesus, it is probably completely alien to how most people imagine how things went down but personally I believe my depiction is not only valid but very likely.<br /><br />However I do not claim to have full knowledge of how things were in that society, cultural practices, political structures, figures of influence, etc. So I am sure people who actually have facts on it will find a lot of holes in my account.<br /><br />Besides that I think my story raises a lot of interesting angles that may be worth exploring if people were so inclined.

	<p class="comment">Thank you for this excellent program, presenting so many points of view on aspects of St John's Gospel which cast 'the Jews' in a  bad light - when nearly all those present in the events leading up to the Crucifixion, apart from a few Romans, were Jews, including Jesus and his disciples. This has bothered me over the years, and I was glad to hear various comments on it. A greater understanding of Jesus' place within Judaism would no doubt have lessened anti-Semitism over many centuries. Yet I feel we are not all that enlightened now - and anti-Semitism is again on the rise in Europe.</p>
