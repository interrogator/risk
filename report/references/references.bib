                   processes, enacting a range of important
                   institutional practices, hence also shaping people's
                   subjectivities. Genres represent purposive and staged
                   ways of building means in a culture. The book's
                   particular claim to originality is that, using
                   systemic functional grammar, it demonstrates how
                   given genres build or enact social practice, how
                   educational setting provide contexts in which some
                   apprenticeship into such genres occurs, and how
                   theorizing about such matters helps build a theory of
                   social action, revealing how powerful is the systemic
                   functional analysis in addressing questions
                   concerning the social construction of reality.The
                   discussion is built around extensive analysis of
                   instances of texts collected in a number of worksites
                   and school settings. While most are instances of
                   written genres, some are spoken, most notably the
                   chapter that is devoted to the discussion of the
                   spoken classroom texts in which the teaching and
                   learning of the written genres take place.},

                   of {\textquoteleft}risk{\textquoteright} have been
                   made in the sociology of risk literature. In this
                   article we present and discuss some empirical data
                   from linguistic corpora that elucidate what risk
                   means in ordinary language. This might provide social
                   scientists with a firmer ground on which to base
                   future statements pertaining to the meaning of risk.
                   After a discussion of the problem, we analyse the
                   word {\textquoteleft}risk{\textquoteright}, as both
                   noun and verb, with recourse to three corpora
                   containing over a hundred million contemporary
                   English words. We examine whether or not the meaning
                   of {\textquoteleft}risk{\textquoteright} is stable
                   and consistent across a variety of social contexts to
                   test the commonplace view that
                   {\textquoteleft}risk{\textquoteright} is at times
                   manipulated in ideological ways. Data from the
                   corpora, and the methods of corpus linguistics,
                   therefore suggest ways of reconsidering claims about
                   the meaning(s) of
                   {\textquoteleft}risk{\textquoteright}.},

                   SiBol 1993 and SiBol 2005 corpora with the objective
                   of diachronic analysis of a particular text type,
                   namely, that of British broadsheet newspapers. I
                   analysed the keyword lists (see Partington, 2010:
                   Section 2) in search of items that could be assigned
                   to semantic sets, which could be glossed as
                   hyperbole, vagueness and informal evaluation. The
                   appearance of these sets in the keywords for 2005
                   seems to point to changes over time in newspaper
                   prose style. The newspapers under consideration thus
                   appear to have altered both in their function and in
                   their relationship with their readership; and this is
                   reflected in the salient lexis and its contexts of
                   use. An increase in conversational and informal
                   styles emerges, along with a notable increase in a
                   particular kind of evaluative and promotional
                   language as a result of a proportional increase in
                   soft news, supplements and reviews. [ABSTRACT FROM

  abstract =      {News is increasingly being produced and consumed
                   online, supplanting print and broadcast to represent
                   nearly half of the news monitored across the world
                   today by Western intelligence agencies. Recent
                   literature has suggested that computational analysis
                   of large text archives can yield novel insights to
                   the functioning of society, including predicting
                   future economic events. Applying tone and geographic
                   analysis to a 30\&ndash;year worldwide news archive,
                   global news tone is found to have forecasted the
                   revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, including
                   the removal of Egyptian President Mubarak, predicted
                   the stability of Saudi Arabia (at least through May
                   2011), estimated Osama Bin Laden\&rsquo;s likely
                   hiding place as a 200\&ndash;kilometer radius in
                   Northern Pakistan that includes Abbotabad, and
                   offered a new look at the world\&rsquo;s cultural
                   affiliations. Along the way, common assertions about
                   the news, such as \&ldquo;news is becoming more
                   negative\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;American news portrays a
                   U.S.\&ndash;centric view of the world\&rdquo; are
                   found to have merit.},
