\begin{abstract}

    Since the 1980s and 1990s the notion of risk has become increasingly influential in societal discourses and scholarly debate \cite{skolbekken_risk_1995}. From early work on risk and culture \cite{douglas_risk_1986,douglas_risk_2013} to the \emph{risk society} thesis \cite{beck_risk_1992,beck_world_2009,giddens_runaway_2002}, from governmentality theorists working in the tradition of Foucault \cite{dean_governmentality:_2010,omalley_risk_2012,rose_powers_1999} to modern systems theory \cite{luhmann_ecological_1989,luhmann_communication_1993} all have built their work around the notion of risk and implicitly or explicitly refer to linguistic changes. Though this body of literature offers different explanations for the shift towards \emph{risk} and its connection to social change, to date there has been no attempt to empirically examine their relative ability to explain this change in the communication of possible harm. 

    % We will address this deficit by examining a number of claims made by different sociological risk approaches in more detail. We will utilise a corpus based approach to examine in detail how the institutional and sociocultural shift towards risk has manifested linguistically.

	To address this defecit, we conduct a corpus-based investigation of risk words in The New York Times between 1963 and mid-2014. The investigation involves the creation of an annotated corpus of over 150,000 risk tokens and their co-text. Purpose-built functions for manipulating this dataset and visualising results were created and used to investigate the corpus according to a systemic-functional conceptualisation of the transitivity system.

    Following the corpus interrogation, we use functional linguistics and sociological risk theory in tandem to analyse the findings. First, SFL is used to link lexicogrammatical phenomena to discourse-semantic meaning of the texts. Longitudinal changes in risk language are then mapped to key events, as well as broader social movements.

    This report is accompanied by an interactive \emph{IPython Notebook} interface to our corpus and developed computational tools. Key findings from this report are stored there, as well as additional information (e.g. concordance lines, keywords, collocation), that could not be included in this report due to spatial considerations. It is available for both interactive and static viewing at \url{https://github.com/interrogator/risk}.
