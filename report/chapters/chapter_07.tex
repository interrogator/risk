\chapter{A comparison of economics, health, and political risks}

In this chapter, we use subcorpora of economics, health and politics articles to understand how risk words change in specific semantic fields. Due to the smaller size of these subcorpora, as a general rule, the kinds of specific grammatical queries used in the previous chapter were not useful, as they generated very low numbers of results. Accordingly, this part of our investigation includes analyses of keywords and n-grams.

            %Due to time constraints, we restricted the topic comparison to domains that had yielded interesting insights in the earlier interrogations. Further, we found that the smaller size of the subcorpora limited us to lexicogrammatical queries that outputted a large enough number of results for quantitative reliability. Thus, we focussed on the following three areas:

\section{Health}

    Our topic subcorpora were much smaller than our main corpus. As a result, lexicogrammatical querying did not yield quantitatively reliable results. Accordingly, other kinds of corpus linguistic investigation, not reliant on grammatical structure, were applied. 

    First, we considered \emph{keywords}---that is, words that were unusually frequent within the health corpus when compared to the corpus as as a whole.

    Linear regression was used to determine the slope of each keyword's trajectory, and ensure that the p-value of this slope was below 0.05. Results were then sorted into two groups, based on the incline\slash decline of the slope.

    \begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{.48\textwidth}

    \caption{Keywords becoming less key over time}
    \label{fig:key-dec}
    \end{minipage}
    \end{figure}

    Next, we were interested in \emph{bigrams}---that is, words that occur beside each other multiple times within a corpus. Bigrams containing a stopword were excluded from analysis, as these results were generally common clusters of closed class words (\emph{in the}, \emph{of a}, \emph{one day}, etc.). Again, linear regression was used to group results into increasing and decreasing groups.

    \noindent
    \begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{.48\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{../images/ngrams-increasing.png}

    \caption{bi-grams becoming less frequent over time}
    \label{fig:ngram-dec}
    \end{minipage}
    \end{figure}

We grouped these into themes, with results entered into one or more categories. Ambiguous results were often concordanced in order to determine the main context of use: \emph{athlete}, for example, could indicate the health condition (\emph{Athlete's foot}), a chain of footwear stores, or denote athletes themselves. The latter was revealed to be by far the most common context, and athlete was thus added to \emph{People, everyday}.

\subsection{Nominal groups in the health subcorpus}

The final part of our investigation of the health subcorpus looked at key nouns or nominal groups. By measuring the slope of trend lines, we could ascertain which groups were becoming more or less common.

    \caption{Relative frequency of nominal groups becoming more frequent over time}

    \caption{Relative frequency of nominal groups becoming less frequent over time}
    \label{fig:4}
    \end{minipage}
    \end{figure}

The first major theme that emerges from this interrogation is the shift from infectious to non-infectious disease.

A second point of interest is the decline in terms related to insurance.

Though the prevalence of health insurance in mid 1990s articles was unexpected, as it corresponds with Hillary Clinton's efforts to increase health insurance coverage in the USA, unexpected was the lack of an upswing in insurance terms during the pushes for healthcare reform throughout the Obama administration.

Also apparent is an upward trend for nominal groups related to research (\emph{study, percent, research, etc.}).

This finding was of particular interest, given that the increasing contestation of academic and scientific research are core hypotheses made by Beck.

Concordancing was used to look for evidence of contestation when the nominal groups related to research were instantiated.

\section{Summary}

Broadly speaking, institutional social actors, political representatives and the like appear to have been displaced by individual human actors and components within their everyday life world.

The exception to this rule is research, which

Though further investigation into the emergence of research as a key semantic domain within risk discourse is needed, we hypothesise that it

The increasing commonality of data journalism, where journalists may conduct

Another potential factor is that the exponential increase in academic publications, as well as the increasing ease of access (via the web) has made reporting of 

This may also be a part of the increase in health risk discourse as well.

The lack of contestation points to an area in which Beck's conceptualisation of risk in late modernity may be at odds




\section{Issues in the health corpus investigation}

The first major issue was the smaller size of the corpus, which necessitated different kinds of analysis.

Within keywording and ngramming, it became clear that broader linguistic change and specific events are difficult to separate.

This, however, is where we can see the clearest examples of the link between events and language change. Interspersed throughout the keywords and n-grams are terms ranging in specificity. It is through categorisation of these varying levels that we can smooth out the 

The keywording in particular revealed a number of ambiguities. A more reliable\slash systematic method for grouping keywords would ameliorate this concern.

\section{Summary}

    The smaller size of topic subcorpora necessitated different kinds of analysis. Fortunately, such methods are well documented within corpus assisted discourse studies. Following on from these methodologies, we located particularly frequent terms, and analysed them in their context of use.

    Ultimately, the ways in which a corpus can be analysed are dependent on the size of the corpus. 


%Comparing the behaviour of risk words in three smaller corpora is complicated by the lack of existing methodologies.

\subsubsection{Beck's notion of increasingly contested science}

We found strikingly little evidence for contestation of scientific\slash academic research in the NYT. As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:research}, research and researchers are typically presented in a neutral

It is important to remember, however, that the representation of research in the NYT may be influenced by a number of independent factors. First, it should be noted that print journalism centred on science is increasingly common. It is affordable, as the journalist does not need to investigate or travel in order to access the content, and much of the article body can consist of quotations from the journal article. It is also deemed reliable, having in many cases already been through peer-review. Given the rapid rise in the number of academic journals, as well as the increased ability to access these journals via the Web, 

A final issue is that the NYT might not be the genre in which the contestation occurs.

Scepticism toward modern medicine, the pharmaceutical industry and the like are typically notions rooted 

Opinion and editorial articles comprise only a small fraction of articles in the NYT.

Key to Beck's notion of Reflexive Modernity is the idea that people confront and contest the science that brought about modernisation via the industrial revolution, as the negative repercussions of this science and modernisation witnessed first-hand (through pollution, etc.) \cite{ross_science_1996}.

Academia---in particular, the humanities and social sciences---has embraced the critical turn of scientific method against itself, under the banner of post-structuralism. Why not print journalism? Many explanations are possible. The rise of print journalism closely parallels modernisation and industrialisation. The production and transmission of newspapers themselves is in many respects reliant upon technology popularised during industrialisation. 


Despite the fact that few possess the requisite knowledge of medicine, environment, etc., to meaningfully assess risks

The inability of science alone to solve conflicts and debates may be so, but this has little bearing on the usefulness of scientific research within print journalism. Journalism is not typically seeking to resolve, but merely to elucidate, sources of conflict and tension in the world at large.

We should also note here that the emergence of science reporting does not necessarily mean than non-scientifically informed medical practice is being displaced:
