\chapter{A comparison of economics, health, and political risks}


Key participants were first tallied (\texttt{/NN.?/ \textgreater \textgreater \# (NP !> PP)}) in order to broadly understand the key social actors in the three subcorpora (see Figure \ref{fig:clouds}).

			Due to time constraints, we restricted the topic comparison to domains that had yielded interesting insights in the earlier interrogations. Further, we found that the smaller size of the subcorpora limited us to lexicogrammatical queries that outputted a large enough number of results for quantitative reliablity. Thus, we focussed on the following three areas:

		 			 	\hline
		 			 	\textbf{Economics}   & \textbf{Health}         & \textbf{Politics}     \\ \hline
		 			 	political   & high           & political    \\ \hline
		 			 	big         & great          & great        \\ \hline

\section{Summary}

	Unlike the general corpus of all articles, these subcorpora made it possible to observe the influence of key events:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Event 1 and 2 in Economics
		\item Event 1 and 2 in Health
		\item Event 1 and 2 in subcorpus 3
	\end{enumerate}
