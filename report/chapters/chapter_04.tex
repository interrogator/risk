\chapter{Case study: the New York Times, 1963--2014}

	Our investigation centred on digitised texts from \emph{New York Times} editions in 1963 and between 1987--2014. These texts (defined here as individual, complete chunks of content) are predominantly news articles, but depending on archiving practices, also included in our corpus is text-based advertising, box scores, lists, classifieds, letters to the editor, and so on. More specifically, we were interested in any  containing at least one `risk word'---any lexical item whose root is risk (\emph{risking}, \emph{risky}, \emph{riskers}, etc.) or any adjective or adverb containing this root (e.g. \emph{at-risk}, \emph{risk-laden}, \emph{no-risk}).\endnote{This was operationalised through the case-insensitive regular expression \textbf{\textbackslash brisk.*?\textbackslash b}, where \textbf{\textbackslash b} acts as a word-boundary marker.}~

	We relied on two sources for our data. The \emph{New York Times Annotated Corpus} \cite{sandhaus_new_2008} was used as the source for all articles published between 1987--2006. ProQuest was used to search for and download articles containing a risk word from 2007--2014, alongside some metadata, in HTML format. We also created a subcorpus of articles from NYT 1963 editions through optimal character recognition (OCR) of PDF documents archived by ProQuest as containing a risk word in either metadata (i.e. title, lede) or content. Due to the time-intensive nature of manual correction of OCR, a random sample of one-third (1218 texts) was selected, with paragraphs of texts containing a risk word being manually corrected by hand.

	Article text and any available metadata were extracted from this unstructured source content using \emph{Python}'s \emph{Beautiful Soup} module and \emph{Shell} scripting, and added to uniquely named text files in annual subfolders. The kinds of metadata available varied according to the data source: The \emph{New York Times Annotated Corpus} provides a number of potentially valuable metadata fields, such as author, newspaper section, and subject (manually added by trained archivists). We then value-added to this partially annotated corpus in three main ways. First, keywords and clusters for each article were calculated using \emph{Spindle} \cite<see>{puerto_spindle_2012} and added as metadata fields. Second, \emph{MALLET} \cite<see>{mccallum_mallet:_2002}, a topic modelling tool, used LDA to algorithmically assign `topics' to each article. The topics and their strengths were added as a metadata field. Finally, we used the \emph{Stanford CoreNLP suite} \cite<see>{manning_stanford_2014} to parse each risk token and its co-text for grammatical structure and dependencies.\endnote{As a part of an ongoing Australian Digital Humanities initiative, since the beginning of our analysis, we have been allocated resources for creating and cloud-hosting a much larger corpus. All 1.8 million articles from the \emph{New York Times Annotated Corpus} were turned into an identically structured, though dramatically larger, cloud-hosted corpus. Interrogation of this corpus was used to determine whether trends in the behaviour of risk words were localised to the word itself, or to general stylistic/language change in the \emph{New York Times}. More details on this project are to be presented in Zinn and McDonald, forthcoming.}~

	A key strength of the methodology is that subcorpora based on article or metadata attributes can can be easily created and compared. Our interest was in creating a small set of topic-specific corpora in order to look for changes in risk word behaviour within specific fields of discourse. As a case study, we decided to focus on three broadly defined topics: \emph{economy}, \emph{health} and \emph{politics}. Librarian-added metadata concerning article topic/category (MC metadata field) was used to locate all articles tagged case-insensitive regular expressions \texttt{\textbackslash beconom.*}, \texttt{\textbackslash bhealth.*} or \texttt{\textbackslash bpolitic.*}.\endnote{We tried a number of strategies for collecting topic subcorpora, such as exploiting topic modeller and keyword metadata. Ultimately, however, we relied on the hand-classification. A limitation of the selected approach is that---an article collected in the health subcorpus was tagged with `Livestock health', for example. Similarly, article categories may be lacking: Figure \ref{fig:exfile} is tagged only with MENINGITIS, and thus is not included in our health subcorpus. More obviously, 1963 articles had not been classified this way, and thus do not feature in the three topic subcorpora.} 

	%\endnote{It would also be possible to create corpora of subtopics: from the politics domain, we could quickly find articles in which Clinton, Bush or Obama are keywords and look for differences in the behaviour of risk words for each politician. Though this seems an interesting area for future research, it was beyond our scope.}~

	We used some of the metadata fields to identify and remove listings (of best-selling books, plays, TV guides, etc.). Reasons for this were threefold. First, the jargon, abbreviations and non-clausal nature of listing language was not handled well by the parser. Second, list content was often repeated verbatim in multiple files, potentially skewing counts. Third, our two data sources archived listings in different ways.

	Listings were located by querying metadata fields in a number of ways. Files with titles such as \emph{Spare Times}, \emph{Best Sellers}, articles with keywords such as `theater', `listing', or days of the week. If a file contained only a listing, the file was removed. If a risk word appeared only within the list portion of an article, the file was deleted. If a file contained both a body and listing, only the listing was removed.

	After all data processing, we had a 150 million word corpus of nearly 150,000 articles containing a risk word published in the NYT or \url{NYT.com} in 1963, and between 1987 and mid 2014. The corpus had 29 annual subcorpora. The three subcorpora of economics, health and politics articles contained a subset of these articles. A breakdown of the size and composition of each annual subcorpus is provided in Table \ref{tab:stats}. Where necessary, frequency counts in the 1963 subcorpus were multiplied by four, to account for the smaller sample size. Frequency counts for 2014 were multiplied by 1.37 to fill in the uncaptured period between August 18--December 31.

One family has lost a child and others may be at risk from a deadly brain inflammation, officials warned yesterday. Bacterial meningitis recently killed a baby who attended the Center day-care program, officials say. They are urging parents and staff at the Center to contact their doctors or a hospital emergency room.
