\chapter{Findings} \label{chap:findings}

    Findings are organised according to the formulation of areas of interest as questions. These questions progress from general frequency counting (Q1), through experiential meanings (Qs 2--7), to risk as modifier (Qs 8 \& 9) and finally to arguability (Q10). Discussion of the general significance of individual findings is also presented in this section, as the Discussion section synergises all findings to explain the discourse-semantics of risk.

A non-interactive version is available at \url{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/interrogator/risk/blob/master/risk.ipynb}. This Notebook does not suffer from spatial limitations, and thus contains additional information, including the exact Tregex queries used in interrogations, as well as complete lists of the concordance lines discussed only briefly here.

\section{How frequently do risk words appear?} \FloatBarrier \label{sect:howfreq}

    %We successfully located a number of lexicogrammatical sites of change within clauses containing a risk word. 

    The first point of interest was the overall frequency of risk words in the NYT (Figure \ref{fig:relative_frequency_of_risk_words}) and the distribution of risk words by word class (nominal, verbal, adjectival\slash adverbial), absent any consideration of surrounding grammar (see Figure \ref{fig:wordclasses}). In terms of the relative frequency of risk words, we note a general upward trend, with a number of peaks and troughs worthy of further investigation. In terms of word classes of risk, we found that not only are nominal forms by far the most common in the NYT, but that it is nominal risk words that vary the most in frequency, with the other categories remaining more or less stable. Interestingly, in the span for which we have no data (1964--1986), adjectival forms overtake verbal forms of risk in frequency.

    %Using our reference corpus, we checked to see whether nominals were becoming more frequent within the NYT more generally.

    \noindent We compared this against the relative frequencies of nominal, verbal and adjectival\slash adverbial lexical items in the corpus as a whole, in order to account for any trends toward nominalisation in our dataset more generally (Figure \ref{fig:wordclasses}). This showed that even when compared to potential trends toward nominalisation generally (Figure \ref{fig:eachperc}), nominal risks are becoming more frequent in later NYT editions. 

    This is an important preliminary finding: verbal groups form the nucleus of experiential meanings, the shift toward nominal risk is in effect a shift toward risk discourse where risk is not the central event being depicted, but is instead a player within a broader range of events. Furthermore, given that nominal risk is closer to synonymous with harm or threat (see Section \ref{sect:diff_between_nom_ver_risk}, shifts toward nominal risks are indeed evidence for Lupton's claim that the semantics of risk increasingly reflect negative outcomes.

    %As nouns congruently perform the role of Participant, the shift toward nominal risks is related to the `participantification' of risk discussed in Section \ref{sect:exprole}.

    These initial findings guided the rest of the investigation: particular attention was paid to nominal risks, as these were the site of the most longitudinal change. That said, these categories provide merely a categorisation of the formal features of risk words. Functionally, things are substantially more complicated: \emph{running a risk}, for example, while featuring a nominal risk, is in reality a risk process; similarly, though risk is nominal in \emph{risk management}, it functions as a modifier, rather than a participant. Accordingly, in our analysis, functional categories are typically preferred over formal categories where possible.

    A similar question is the number of unique risk words appearing per year. Figure \ref{fig:diffriskwords} demonstrates that there is a general increase in the relative number of unique risk words over time.\endnote{1963 is excluded from analysis here, as poor quality OCR created a number of non-word results such as \emph{risks-wnrk}, \emph{risks.North} and \emph{risks.With}.}

\section{Which experiential roles do risk words occupy?} \label{sect:exprole} \FloatBarrier

    In a systemic-functional conceptualisation of the experiential metafunction of language (that is, the ways in which language is used to communicate who did what to whom), risk words may take the form of a Participant (\emph{The risk was there}), Process (\emph{I risked it}) or a Modifier (\emph{a risky encounter}). Though these pattern to some extent with word classes (e.g. \emph{participant = noun, process = verb, modifier = adjective}), word classes on the whole are a poor indication of functional role, especially in genres such as print news journalism,  which rely heavily on nominalisation and grammatical metaphor to pack large amounts of experiential information into each clause. As shown in Table \ref{tab:class_and_role}, for example, nominal risks commonly perform Modifier functions, and adjectival functions often perform Participant functions.

    \begin{table}
    \small
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Example}       & \textbf{Word class}     & \textbf{Experiential role}     \\ \hline
    \emph{It was risky}  & Adjective  &  Participant   \\ \hline
    \emph{A risking of lives} & Noun  &  Nominalised process   \\ \hline
    \emph{Risk management}  & Noun & Modifier   \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Key differences between word class and experiential role}
    \label{tab:class_and_role}
    \end{table}

    Using Stanford CoreNLP's dependency parses, we counted the frequency of risk words within these three functional roles (Figure \ref{fig:funcrole}). In line with the results from word-class based searching, we find that risk as a Process is declining in use. Risk as Modifier, patterning in part with adjectival risk, appears to be increasing. That said, we can also see here the affordances of a functional grammar in corpus assisted discourse research: in this case, much richer evidence of changing usage of risk can be found through an understanding of its semantic function rather than its word class alone.

    The decline of risk as a Process can be read as a shift away from the `risk frame' identified by \citeA{fillmore_toward_1992}. Their frame is essentially a mapping of the possible kinds of participants that can occur when risk is used as a process. In a very typical risk process, such as \emph{He risked everything}, \emph{He} is the Actor and everything is the \emph{Valued Object}. Risk as participant is less likely to explicitly index the major components of the risk frame: in \emph{The risk must be weighed against the benefit}, we are not given any specific information about the configuration of the risk scenario. (Risk as modifier encompasses a number of functional roles. As such, we leave this discussion for sections \ref{sect:mod_one} and \ref{sect:mod_two}.)

    Like with our analysis of the word classes of risk, we can also understand the shifts in the experiential roles of risk words as evidence for an increasing implicitness of risk in NYT news discourse. As mentioned earlier, in a systemic-functional conceptualisation of language, the process is the locus of experiential meaning---it selects the kinds of participants that can occur as its arguments. Modifiers and circumstances are the least consequential kinds of experiential meaning, as they provide ancillary or supplementary kinds of meaning, regarding the manners in which processes were performed, or characteristics of participants. 

    %Nominalisation is also closely tied to arguability. This link is discussed in Section \ref{sect:arguability}.

    %``From studies comparing identical and fraternal twins, it is estimated that genetic factors account for 40 to 60 percent of the variation in the risk for addiction.''

    %That was just one day after Richard S. Fuld Jr. , Lehman 's chief executive , announced a new strategy that he said would `` accomplish a significant de-risking of our balance sheet , '' in part by putting risky assets into a new company it would spin off to shareholders next year .

    % `` Ambac has consistently emphasized that in this period of extreme uncertainty in the capital markets , the de-risking and de-leveraging of our balance sheet is our highest priority , '' David W. Wallis , the chief executive , said in a news release .

\section{Is risk more commonly in the position of experiential subject or experiential object?} \FloatBarrier

    Risk as a participant may take the form of an experiential subject or an experiential object.\endnote{These are not particularly meaningful distinctions in SFL, as the role of participants depends on the process type. Though process type identification is becoming more and more feasible \cite<see>{odonnell_uam_2008}, at the time of our investigation, we lacked resources to automatically distinguish between process types, and thus relied on borrowed notions of experiential subject- and objecthood.} 
    Our first area of interest was the proportion of each, with respect to general trends in the NYT. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:bestexpsubjobj}, risk is more commonly an object than a subject. It is also apparent that risk as experiential subject is on an static trajectory, while risk as experiential object is inbound. The significance of this is discussed in more depth in Section \ref{sect:arguability}.

    Interesting here is the dominance of processes seeking to quantify risk (\emph{increase}, \emph{outweigh}, \emph{rise}, \emph{grow}). Also salient is the presence of a large set of mental processes (\emph{seem, appear, assess, understand, accept}). This may be seen as evidence for an increased demand for the control of risk (see discussion in sections \ref{sect:mod_two}; contrast with section \ref{sect:highpotential})).

    %Future research is planned to divide processes with risk participants into the systemic functional conceptualisation of process types. Potentially, we could determine whether or not risks are shifting to or from mental to material.

\section{How are participant risks modified?} \label{sect:highpotential} \FloatBarrier

    Most commonly, risk as a participant is modified through adjectival pre-head modification or post-head modification with a subordinate clause or prepositional phrase. Ignoring the distinction between subject and object risk, and collapsing pre-head and post-head kinds of modification, Tables \ref{tab:prehead} and \ref{tab:posthead} show the most common pre- and post-head modifiers of risk as a participant.

    Some of these modifiers are undergoing longitudinal trajectory change. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:reladjrisk}, \emph{calculated risk} has an outbound trajectory, decreasing steadily. The large number of occurrences projected for 1963, however, is partially the result of the 1962 Broadway play by the same name. Of course, the choice of name for the production may also serve as evidence for the salience of the construction in the earlier samples.  \emph{Potential risk}, on the other hand, is increasing in frequency. Also interesting is the spike in the \emph{high risk} construction between 2002--2004. Here, concordancing reveals links to particular events. \emph{High risk}, peaking in 2004, is asociated with the outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu outbreak:

\section{What kinds of risk processes are there, and what are their relative frequencies?} \FloatBarrier

    Our second area of interest within the transitivity system is risk as a process. Within the corpus, we located five distinct risk processes. First, risk alone may be a process (\emph{I won't risk it}). Second and third are \emph{running risk} and \emph{taking risk}---\emph{process--range} configurations, where the verbal component is largely shorn of meaning, and with meaning conveyed primarily in the nominal in object position \cite{halliday_introduction_2004}. Fourth is \emph{putting somebody/something at risk}, which involves an obligatory nominal object argument and a prepositional-phrase complement. Finally, we have \emph{pose risk}, which differs again in terms of participant roles: the entity who may suffer a negative outcome is realised circumstantially (\emph{The legislation poses no risk to federally licensed facilities}), with the nature of the potential harm generally left implicit.

    Other \emph{process $+$ nominal risk word} constructions sit on the cusp of being recognisable risk processes: \emph{to carry risk}, for example, is frequent in the data, but we have not included it because we feel that the semantic burden of this process still lies in \emph{carry} (unlike \emph{pose} in \emph{to pose risk}).\endnote{Further research devoting more time to which examples constitute risk processes and which constitute experiential objects of other processes seems timely.}

    \caption{Risk processes as percentage of all parsed processes}
    \label{fig:riskprocesses}
    \end{figure}
    %
    \noindent Our first interest is the overall frequency of these five risk processes. 
    %From Figure \ref{fig:riskprocesses}, we concluded that risk processes generally are on an static\slash slightly outbound trajectory, with a notable decrease in frequency between the 1963--1987 samples.
    Figure \ref{fig:riskprocesses} charts the trajectory of the five identified risk processes. Most interesting here are that the `standard' (i.e. predicatorial) risk process is steadily decreasing, in favour of the other processes, each of which seems to provide additional connodations of the agency of the risker as well as his\slash her\slash its understanding of the level of risk. 

    The second notable finding here is that \emph{putting at risk} has overtaken \emph{running risk} in frequency. Concordancing revealed that in 2014, \emph{putting at risk} is used in cases where the potential harm is either implicit (left) or explicit (right):
    %
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{enumerate}  [before=\color{black}\ttfamily] \setlength\itemsep{0em} \small
    \item Ultimately, there is a price to pay: If you attack our soldiers, you're putting yourself at risk.
    \item But addicted health care workers need not be physicians to put patients at risk.
    \item While obviously no airline or company deliberately puts people at risk, `sometimes new risks are identified and steps have to be taken,' Mr. Koch said.
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    \begin{enumerate}  [before=\color{black}\ttfamily] \setlength\itemsep{0em} \small
    \item The auction houses deny that they are trimming profits with givebacks or putting themselves at financial risk.
    \item Rather, such tax status is generally put at risk when groups stray from their mission.
    \item They had handled her body, putting them at serious risk of infection.
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{multicols}
    %
    \noindent That said, we also noted that there seems to be some evidence for lessening agency in recent \emph{risk running} processes. Compare 1963 (left) and 2014 (right) results:

    \begin{multicols}{2}

    \begin{enumerate} [before=\color{black}\ttfamily]  \setlength\itemsep{0em} \small
    \item However, if adults decide to run a risk, this is up to them, and anyway, Switzerland adequately handles American affairs in Havana.
    \item In Washington at the weekend it was pretty welt agreed that the MIG incident was not deliberate provocation; the feeling was that, even with the Russian presence, Castro would not wilfully run the risk of American retaliation.
    \item  If he sticks to the more-or-less official Republican position against off-track betting, he runs the risk of losing thousands of New York City votes, which he needs.
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    \begin{enumerate} [before=\color{black}\ttfamily]   \setlength\itemsep{0em} \small
    \item Fans see this revolving door of injuries with so much regularity that they run the risk of becoming desensitized 
    \item `One runs the risk of falling for a voice.'
    \item `I would run the risk of having two boys,' she said.
    \item On the other hand, if Argentina does default, it runs the risk of more lawsuits, said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies.
    \item And, like an overdressed beachgoer, a classic cocktail served straight up runs a high risk of wilting in the sunshine.
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{multicols}
    %
    \noindent Overall, the shift in both the semantics of risk running and the increasing preference for \emph{putting at risk} can be seen as evidence for decreasing agency in risk, as well as an increasing implicitness of the potential harm. This finding is especially significant, given that the existing descriptions of risk \cite{fillmore_toward_1992}, as well as the current FrameNet database, include accounts of \emph{running risk} as a frame, but not \emph{putting at risk}.

    Both \emph{pose risk} and \emph{put at risk} have overtaken \emph{run risk} in frequency. Use of the prototypical risk process, \emph{to risk} is declining. Finally, there is some evidence for reduced agency the \emph{run risk} process.}

\section{When risk is a process, what participants are involved?} \FloatBarrier
    
    Clauses containing risk processes are a rich site for analysis, as the semantic roles of participants are determined by their placement with respect to the process. In frame semantic terms, experiential subjects of risk processes can often be mapped to \emph{actors}.\endnote{A limitation of frame semantics is its ability to deal with other kinds of risk processes: in \emph{The site posed risks}, \emph{pose} is the experiential subject, but not the actor or risker.}~Experiential objects are either \emph{valued objects} or \emph{harm} (\emph{they risked their lives/death}). Table \ref{tab:riskersx} lists the most common subject and object participants of risk processes. Also of interest are clauses embedded within risk processes (e.g. \emph{she risks hurting herself\slash losing her life}). Table \ref{alienating} lists the (lemmatised) top twenty subordinated processes in the corpus.

    \noindent Riskers are most typically powerful institutions or individuals. Risked things and potential harms are generally serious and grave. A mismatch occurs here: \emph{Bush} and \emph{Obama} do not likely risk \emph{wounds}, \emph{arrest} or \emph{death}. In terms of subordinated processes, notable is the appearance of processes that are fairly uncommon: \emph{alienating}, \emph{offending}, \emph{undermining} and \emph{angering} and are three key examples, ranking amongst expected processes like \emph{being}, \emph{having}, \emph{getting}, \emph{making} and \emph{going}. Without considering longitudinal change, we can see from this that the embedded processes are often related to more powerful social actors: states, political parties and politicians risk alienating electorates; diplomats risk offending one another. Even embedded processes lacking explicit connotations of power are typically deployed in the contexts of government, industry or society. Table \ref{alienating} shows concordance results for \emph{risk alienating} in 2013, which appears 14 times.

    Modifier risks are unique for their variety and diversity: through compounding, comprehensible new risk words and phrases can easily be created. The entire corpus contained 327 unique adjectival risk words, including \emph{non-risk}, \emph{de-risk}, \emph{once-risky}, \emph{take-no-risks}, \emph{risk-swapping}, \emph{risk-abhorrent}, \emph{price-for-risk}, \emph{post-risky}, \emph{pooled-risk}, \emph{personal-risk}, \emph{optimum-risk}, \emph{one-risk-factor}, \emph{one-pitch-can-end-his-career-risk} and \emph{low-risk-to-society}. That said, most of these occur no more than a handful of times. By far the most common were \emph{risky\slash riskier\slash riskiest} (15588 occurrences), \emph{high-risk} (5533), \emph{low-risk} (1086), \emph{at-risk} (902), \emph{risk-free} (883) and \emph{risk-taking} (789). Of these, four exhibited trajectory shifts (see Figure \ref{fig:adjtraj}). The basic adjectival forms (\emph{risky}, \emph{riskier}, \emph{riskiest}) are dominant in the 1963 sample, then decrease, and re-emerge in 2000. \emph{High-risk} though very rare (two instances) in 1963, has become more common, and stabilised in trajectory. \emph{Low-risk} and \emph{at-risk} are on a consistent inbound trajectory.

    The prevalence of \emph{high-risk} in the 1980s is largely due to the AIDS epidemic: concordancing reveals that certain populations (gays, African Americans, Haitians) are at high-risk of being inflected by HIV. \emph{At-risk} is rare in earlier editions, but increases in prevalence steadily. This shift in risk is modifier is an important one. \emph{Low-}, \emph{moderate-} and \emph{high-risk} comprises a gradient, or scale, while \emph{at-risk} is a binary. As with the shift toward \emph{potential risk}, this indicates both an increasing pervasiveness and a decreasing calcuability of risk. %remember that low-risk is actually increasing.

\section{When risk is a modifier, what is being modified?} \label{sect:mod_two} \FloatBarrier 

    Risk as a modifier can be placed either before or after the noun it modifies (\emph{an at-risk person\slash a person at risk}). These two constructions are collapsed in Tables \ref{tab:riskmodified} and \ref{tab:atrisk}, which respectively list the participants most frequently modified by any risk modifier, and the participants most frequently modified by \emph{at-risk\slash at risk}. Note that while risk-modified participants generally are financial and economic in nature (\emph{investment, business, loan, asset}), the at-risk subset is mainly comprised of vulnerable populations of people (\emph{women}, \emph{children}, \emph{students}). In contrast, as can be seen in the concordance lines presented in Table \ref{conc:investbusinessbehavior}, risk modifiers attaching to financial participants are generally either bare adjectival forms (\emph{risky}, \emph{riskier}, \emph{riskiest}), or quantified variants (\emph{low-}, \emph{high-}, \emph{higher-risk}).

\end{table}

    In need of further research is whether or not the list of entities that can sensibly be modified by \emph{at-risk} is beginning to grow: since the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis (beginning in 2007), references to \emph{at-risk homeowners} appear to be on the rise. Results from 2011, for example, show that \emph{nations} and even \emph{economic sectors} are being modified with \emph{at-risk}:

    \begin{enumerate}  [before=\color{black}\ttfamily] \setlength\itemsep{0em} \small
    \item Mr. Obama asked for \$400 million for the World Bank's clean technology fund, \$95 million for the bank's program to prevent deforestation and \$90 million for its program to help at-risk nations cope with the effects of a warming planet by, for instance, developing drought-resistant crops.
    \item The most at-risk sectors included auto components and automobile companies, which generate nearly 30 percent of their sales in Europe, as well as food and tobacco firms.
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    Note that it is difficult to reconcile the semantic meaning of \emph{at-risk} constructions with the semantic frame of risk provided by \citeA{fillmore_toward_1992}. Though elements of both the \textsc{victim} and \textsc{valued object} appear to be at work, neither provides an adequate label for \emph{at-risk people, children, homeowners or nations}. Rather than being an oversight during the articulation of the risk frame (recall Figure~\ref{fig:fil_atk}), in light of the increased use of these kinds of constructions since the mid 1990s, we hypothesise that \emph{at-risk} constructions (as well as \emph{to put at risk}) are demonstrative of a broader shift in risk discourse toward general clusters of negative outcomes, rather than specific and measurable potential harms. Connection between this shift and sociological theory is made in the following chapter.

\section{How arguable is risk?} \label{sect:arguability} \FloatBarrier

    As noted earlier, our central concern with the Mood system is the degree of arguability associated with the concept of risk. Risk in Subject, Finite and Predicator positions is the most arguable. Risk words within Complements and Adjuncts are less arguable.

    %A dependency grammar attempts to locate a lexical root for each clause, and attach dependents to it recursively until no lexical items are unattached. Each word is ordered by its dependency to the root of a clause. The nature of the dependency relationship can also be provided. Such grammars are particularly useful for free word order language, but have been applied to English successfully as well.

    Based on the kinds of parsing provided by Stanford CoreNLP, it was possible to measure arguability in two ways. First, we can map dependency relationships to the systemic-functional notion of arguability. A dependency grammar locates the predicator of a clause and assigns it a position of zero. A `1' is then assigned to its most immediate dependent (other components in the verbal group, if present, or the head of the Subject, if not). This process continues until no lexical items are unattached, or `ungoverned'. In effect, the higher the number attached to a word, the further it is semantically from being an important component in the meaning, and thus, in systemic functional terms, the less arguable the word.

    \label{fig:depnum}
    \end{figure}
    %
    Figure \ref{fig:depnum} shows that in early samples, risk occupies core roles within the dependency hierarchy, and thus sits closer to the core part of the meaning being exchanged within the clause. In later samples, risk more commonly occurs later in the dependency structure, in less focial positions. As explained earlier, though this experimental method is not a perfectly reliable indicators of arguability, it does indicate an increasing preference to position risk as non-core, ancillary information, rather than as the main thing which is under discussion (See Table \ref{conc:distanceroot}).

    %\endnote{Dependency place 2 and 3 removed from visualisation, as these roles are typically for finites and modal auxiliaries---positions that a risk word cannot grammatically fill.}

    The second thing we can use dependency output for is identifying the functional roles of risk words. This is more accurate than using the dependency ranking, but creates a long list of functional roles. Of key interest, however, are risk words at the head of each major component of the Mood system---Subject, Finite\slash Predicator, Complement and Adjunct (CoreNLP parses unfortunately do not distinguish between Finite and Predicator in a reliable way, so the categories are collapsed here). From Figure \ref{fig:interpersonalarg}, we can see that risk is shifting from Subject and Finite\slash Predicator to Complement and Adjunct roles. This is an important result: risk words in more arguable roles are steadily decreasing, while risk in less arguable roles are becoming more common. Like earlier findings, this suggests an increasing implicitness of risk in NYT discourse, with less talk actually \emph{about} risk, but more talk where the relationship between risk and the subjects of the talk is assumed to be more or less common knowledge.

    %By providing each role with a relative weight, we can plot arguability as a single decreasing trend line, showing the increased implicitness of risk within the language of the NYT.

    %Using the full list of risk dependencies, we can also locate more specific constructions undergoing trajectory shift. Figure \ref{fig:salienttrajectories} shows that risk is increasingly instantiated within prepositional phrases (which are by their nature dependent on Participants and Processes), and decreasingly as a predicator. From this view too, risk words are increasingly implicit within news language.

\section{Risk words and proper nouns} \FloatBarrier

    We searched for proper noun groups in parse trees containing a risk word. This is a departure from many of our earlier queries, as here we are looking only at which entities co-occur with risk words, rather than determining how risk words and non-risk words relate to other another lexicogrammatically. The result of this query was 68891 unique proper noun groups. We took the 200 most common results, and merged any that denoted the same entity: \emph{F.D.A.\slash Food and Drug Administration}, or \emph{Federal Reserve and Fed}. We then grouped results into thematic categories: \emph{People}, \emph{Nations}, \emph{Geopolitical entities}, \emph{Companies}, \emph{Organisations} and \emph{Medical themes}. The results were then plotted (see Figure \ref{fig:propernouns}).

    A number of historical events were easily recognisable within the peaks and troughs of these charts. Key events represented through these interrogations include:

    \item The First Persian Gulf War (Figure~\ref{fig:b})                   
    \item The Iraq Wars (Figure~\ref{fig:b})
    \item September 11 and the War in Afghanistan (Figure~\ref{fig:b})

    \item The Space Shuttle Colombia Disaster (Figure~\ref{fig:d})
    \item The collapse of Enron (Figure~\ref{fig:e})

    \item The recall of Vioxx (Figure~\ref{fig:f})

    This area of our investigation is perhaps the most promising as a means of connecting risk language to particular people and events. 

    Spatial considerations have precluded a full treatment of the charting of risk language to specific events, despite the fact that enough data exists for detailed analyses of any number of potential foci. Future research that centres on detailed exploration of health domains (including the Vioxx recall) is planned.

\section{Summary of key findings}

    We found that the behaviour of risk words has changed longitudinally in a number of key respects:

    \begin{enumerate} \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Risk words appear to be increasing in relative frequency, with modest increases in the number of unique risk words per year.
    \item Risk as a process is declining in use, and has been overtaken in frequency by risk as a participant.
    \item Risk is more often an experiential object than an experiential subject. The gap has widened considerably over time.
    \item \emph{Calculated risk} has been overtaken by \emph{potential risk} in overall frequency. \emph{High-risk} spikes in frequency in references to H5N1.
    \item When risk is a participant, quantification is often at the centre of the experiential meaning. The high proportion of mental processes highlights a portrayal of risks as perceived.
    \item Both \emph{pose risk} and \emph{put at risk} have overtaken \emph{run risk} in frequency. Use of the prototypical risk process, \emph{to risk} is declining. Finally, there is some evidence for reduced agency the \emph{run risk} process.
    \item When risk is a process, risked things\slash potential harms often pertain to individual health. This contrasts with processes as potential harm, which generally relate to people in positions of power.
    \item Common risk modifiers (\emph{risky}, \emph{riskier}, \emph{riskiest}) are gradually being displaced by a number of less common constructions (e.g. \emph{low-risk}, \emph{at-risk}, \emph{risk-averse}, \emph{risk-free})
    \item While risk as a modifier is often used in the context of finance\slash commerce, \emph{at-risk} typically attaches to vulnerable human demographics.
    \item  Longitudinally, risk words are shifting to less focal parts of clauses. We can approximate these changes using both indices or semantic function information within dependency parses.
    \item Proper nouns co-occurring with risk words highlight the close relationship between risk and health discourse.
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    As will be discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:discussion}, many of these shifts appear to be a part of a broader discourse-semantic trend of implicitness and inarguability of risk. 

    % In the following chapter, interrogations used here are applied to subcorpora of Economics, Politics and Health articles.
