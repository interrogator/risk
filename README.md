## Discourse-semantics of risk in the *New York Times*, 1963--2014: a corpus linguistic approach

This repository contains everything created and used in our longitudinal analysis of risk language in the *New York Times*. The investigation involves systematic analysis of over 150,000 NYT paragraphs containing a risk token (*risk*, *risking*, *at-risk*, *risk-to-reward*, *risk-laden*, etc). These paragraphs have been parsed with *Stanford CoreNLP*, and are interrogated using *Tregex* queries, combined with custom-built Python scripts for viewing and merging results, concordancing, etc.

Our *IPython Notebook* presents the code used in our analysis side-by-side with our results. It can be viewed via nbviewer [here](). Our report, which contextualises and elaborates on these results, is available [as PDF]() and (bleeding-edge) [.tex source](). If you want to interrogate the corpus yourself, you are advised to clone the repository, which includes the parse trees, and use the provided functions within the IPython Notebook.

## Forthcoming:

* Support for dependency parsing
* Parse tree visualisation
* Code used to build corpora
* Installation info
